# Arduino-Reflow-Oven
This device controls a pizza oven to produce temperature ramps to use it as a [reflow oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflow_oven). Therefore
several simple modifications are done. The builtin control is disconnected and the heater is controlled
through an opto-SSR (optocoupled solid state relay).

This reflow oven can therefore be used to produce a variety of temperature profiles - not only for reflow
soldering.

## What is a reflow oven used to
To populate PCBs width components you could either use a soldering iron and solder each component by hand
or you can use a reflow oven. To use a reflow oven you put soldering paste onto the pads and put your
components on top. The you bake it in an oven - a reflow oven. The special functionality of a reflow oven
is that you can produce temperature profiles. This is to solder the components as gently as possible but
also guarantee good solder joints.

## Requirements
